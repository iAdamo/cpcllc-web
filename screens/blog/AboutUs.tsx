        In Lagos, where dreams thrive but competition is fierce, a small
        business owner struggled to be seen. Her passion was undeniable, but her
        voice was lost in the noise. This challenge sparked an ideaâ€”a vision for
        a partner who could help businesses like hers not just survive, but
        thrive.
